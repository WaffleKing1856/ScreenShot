# ScreenShot
A simple C# app that can take screenshots of your current screen, it can also detect the amount of e's on the screen.
The algorithm uses an OCR called tesseract to take the screenshot saved in memory and reads all of the characters on the screen. It then just simply counts the number of
the letter "e" that it finds in the array.
Thanks, for checking out the project.
